## Design

### Design Choices
The design is meant to be simple and easy to visually understand, while also evoking the aesthetic of 8-bit video games, as they are a historical part of the pop-culture and fantasy genre. The background is meant as a visualization of ‘dungeon diving’ which is a play on the site’s name and the cliche act found in many fantasy series. 

### Colour
The colours used are dark and cool, visually lending to the feel of being in the dark or subterranean spaces, hammering home the ‘dungeon’ theme of the background style, as well as accenting the dragon tokens used. 

### Fonts
The font used is pixelated and again is meant to evoke the video games of the past, being both nostalgic and modern. The Google Fonts family chosen was VT323.

### Structure
The structure of the website is simple, by design, and comprises three individual pages, one for each game and one for the contact form. The navigation is simple and intuitive, and with a simple underline highlights the page the user currently is one. 
<br>
-Game: The page where the memory game resides, also the main landing page of the site.
<br>
-Quiz: This page generates trivia quiz questions while displaying the number the user is on, and score.
<bn>
-Contact Us: This page is a simple form allowing the user to submit feedback on their experience.

## Bugs

### JHint EMailJS Error
When I ran my JavaScript for the Contact Us page JHint threw up an error about the email.js being used, and after research I understand this is a common occurance with JHint, as EmailJS works perfectly fine, as is, with the code snipets used. 
<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>
<img src="docs/screenshots/formJAVAValid error.png">
</details>

### JHint 'is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6' or '8' etc)
My files are throwing up a warning that states certain syntax and code uses is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6'), or 8, etc. I was unable to remove these messages but in my research I found that these are not errors in my code but something to do with how JHint validates.
